ProFit Assessment Flow: Personalizing Your Health Journey

ProFit includes an assessment flow designed to gather important information about users’ health, mood, and goals to provide a tailored fitness experience. This assessment is available to all users, with a few additional steps for female users.

1. Assessment Overview
Females: The assessment consists of 10 screens, including an extra screen dedicated to menstrual cycle tracking.
Males: The assessment consists of 9 screens.
Users can skip the entire assessment or choose to complete specific parts. This flexibility allows users to control how much information they want to provide at any given time.
2. Assessment Screens
The assessment gathers a variety of personal information to help customize the user experience. Here’s what is covered:

User Goal: Users are asked about their goals for using the app, such as reducing stress, becoming more active, eating healthier, or managing time better.

Mood: The user’s current mood is captured, with options ranging from “Over the Moon” to “Sad.”

Body Metrics: Users input their weight and height, and their BMI (Body Mass Index) is automatically calculated.

Menstrual Cycle (Females Only): Female users are asked to provide details about their menstrual cycle, such as the start and end dates of their last period and their average cycle length.

Professional Help: Users are asked whether they have previously sought professional help (e.g., psychologists, physicians).

Physical Distress: The user is asked if they are experiencing any physical pain or discomfort.

Sleep Quality: Users rate the quality of their sleep based on different time ranges (e.g., 7-9 hours for excellent).

Medication Use: Users can specify whether they are taking prescribed medications, over-the-counter medications, or none at all.

Medication Details: For users who are taking medications, they can select from a list of over 100 medicines, with a built-in search function to find specific drugs.

Mental Health Symptoms: Users are asked about other mental health symptoms they may be experiencing, such as anxiety, depression, mood swings, fatigue, or persistent sadness.

Stress Level: Users are asked to rate their stress level on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 indicating no stress at all and 5 indicating high levels of stress.
